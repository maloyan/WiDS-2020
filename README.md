There are 3 jupyter notebooks:

- DataCleaningFeatureSelection.ipynb is where we preprocessed data e.g. cleaning, generation of new features. If you run that you'll get two final files which you can use for modeling.

- In Modeling.ipynb we did some feature engeneering. We dropped some features like ICU\_id and hospital\_id. All modeling stuff is also in this file

- In FeatureSelection.ipynb we made some feature selection using a LOFO library from here https://github.com/aerdem4/lofo-importance
